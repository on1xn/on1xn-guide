# Skyrim Guide for the Blind by ON1XN


I originally created this project as a personal notebook, but I think other blind players could also benefit from these guides.


To manage expectations, please note that this is **not an official setup guide. It won't cover basic mod installations, how to use them, or standard in-game workarounds unless specifically requested or if I personally find it essential. Because of this, the content is best suited for upper-beginner, intermediate, or advanced players. That being said, I tend to write my guides in great detail, so even if you are a beginner, I'm hope you'll be able to follow along. Although, some basic details / info, I may not mention at all, please keep in mind. 


> Note: All guides relate to mod installation, I'm using MO2. So I can't answer any questions about vortex.


Another major objective of this project is to list of interesting and accessible mods for blind players. By using this list, you can easily pick mods that I have already personally tested, saving you from the exhausting task of browsing through all 137,000+ mods available on Nexus mod. Futhermore, I'll listed non-accessible mods as well, to prevent wasting time to install them.


Interestingly, my list includes many things that sighted players regularly install, such as quest expanders, immersion mods, body physics, weapons, and clothing. These are things that a typical blind player might not install at all (but I did anyway!). This list will expand slowly over time, as I can't install everything at once, and I want to fully experience the vanilla game before adding mods that extend the main storyline, events, or quests.

## Guides


* **[Skyrim Input Layout, and the blind mage happy meal](guides/input_layout.md)**

---

## Mods Section

In this section, I have included both **accessible** and **non-accessible** mods. Some popular mods in the Skyrim community are completely inaccessible for blind players. Since they are so famous, I've tried a bunch of them myself.

Below, you'll find the mod names, Nexus download links, and brief descriptions of what they do. If I have written a dedicated guide for a specific mod, I will link that as well.

To make this list easier to navigate, the accessible mods are split into subcategories: **Immersion**, **Weapons/Armor/Spells/Clothing**, and **Miscellaneous**. I have also included a separate section for fashion, body physics, and visual mods—things that don't affect gameplay but are fun for customization. (Yes, headache too.)

### Accessible Mods

#### Immersion


* **[PC Head Tracking and Voice Type SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11993)**, 
I highly recommend to install. This mod brings your character to life by adding attack grunts, jump sounds, and custom voice lines (ranging from 50 to 700 lines depending on the voice pack). Your character will comment on the current weather, speaking during map transitions, uttering spell names, or shouting at enemies. A little small guide and recommended voice packs is coming soon.


* **[PC Head Tracking - MCM - Increased Sound Files Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139280)**, 
To increase the limit for all b.y.o voice files from 5 to 10. Some voice packs require you to install this thinny mod (actually it's a patch) to make their pack less repetitive commenting.


* **[Crash On Save Fix for PC Head Tracking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63676)**, 
Again the patch to fix PCH doesn't save your PCH configuration when reopening the game. Highly recommend.


* **[Smart Talk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/161500)**, 
This mod enhances the flow of in-game dialogues. It introduces natural, realistic pauses between dialogue lines so NPCs don't talk over each other, and it reorders your conversation choices. With this mod, the dialogue options most relevant to your current quest are automatically pushed to the top of the list. If you install the optional files, you can also fully customize these settings via the MCM. 
I highly recommended as a companion mod, as several PC Head Tracking voice packs actually require or recommend having Smart Talk installed.


#### Weapons, Armor, and Spells


Most weapon, armor, and spell mods are generally accessible by nature. However, the weapon comes with clothing packs can be a bit tricky and should be checked on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, you should be perfectly safe installing them without any issues. Below is the list of mods that I am currently using:


* **[Katana Crafting SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5306)**, 
As the name suggests, this mod adds craftable Japanese Katanas to Skyrim. It is extremely well-balanced, with katanas swinging only 0.2 to 0.25 times faster than vanilla swords.


#### Miscellaneous


* **[JS Unlock Everything SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53159)**
If you are tired of the lockpicking minigame, this mod is your best friend. It automatically bypasses the minigame, and you can configure it via the MCM (Mod Configuration Menu) to still award lockpicking EXP and consume lockpicks as usual.


* **[Simple Mod Item Spawner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64653)**
Highly recommended if you install custom weapons, armor, or clothing mods, as many of them do not include crafting recipes. While it is primarily used for modded items, you can always use standard console commands if you want to spawn vanilla potions or gear.

### Non-Accessible Mods


These are mods that are either highly incompatible with Skyrim Access or outright impossible to navigate as a blind player (I may split them to subcategories in the future):


* **Gamepad Utility Mods (e.g., Wheeler - Quick Action Wheel, Gamepad++, Serio's Cycle Hotkeys, iEquip)**
These mods are completely inaccessible or break Skyrim Access's input translation. It is much better to avoid them, and use my custom Steam Input layout instead.


* **Dragonborn Voice Over 2**, 
Unfortunately, in the current state of Skyrim Access, the SKSE Menu Framework is not yet supported. Because this mod relies heavily on that framework to function and configure its settings, it is currently completely inaccessible for blind players. I really hope the Skyrim Access developers will implement compatibility for the SKSE Menu Framework in the future so we can finally experience this amazing mod. 

What this mod does? This is a much larger and more ambitious project than PC Head Tracking. While many sighted players use both mods together to maximize their character's voice capabilities, DBVO2 for short, goes a step further by giving your protagonist a fully voiced dialogue system. Instead of your character being a silent hero during conversations, this mod generates high-quality voice lines for every single dialogue option you select, making the storytelling experience incredibly immersive.


* **ENBs and Community Shaders**, 
Not only those are graphical mod that most blind players doesn't get any benefit from them and being heavy on your GPU/CPU, they are incredibly tedious to set up. Community Shaders are slightly easier to manage than ENB, but they can still cause silent errors or shader compilation issues that you won't easily notice without a sighted friend looking at your screen. 

moreover, both ENBs and Community Shaders use the **End** key by default to open their in-game GUI, which directly conflicts with Skyrim Access keybinds. Many of them do not offer an easy way to rebind this key. *(I might wrestle with this again in the future just so I can share pretty screenshots with my sighted friends, but that's a project for another day!)*
